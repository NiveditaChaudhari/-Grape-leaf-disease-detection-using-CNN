# Grape-leaf-disease-detection-using-CNN
Brown spot, downy mildew, black rot, leaf blight, mites, and anthracnose are common diseases found on grape leaves. Accurately diagnosing and identifying a disease can reduce its spread and control it over time. This review article considers the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in grape leaf disease detection. The proposed decision system utilizes image content, characterization, and supervised classifier types of neural networks. Image processing techniques for this type of decision analysis include pre-processing, feather extraction, and classification phases in the resizing process. Colour and texture feathers are extracted as input to the trainer. This system is used to automatically classify leaves and determine their characteristics. We address the methodology for CNN-based disease detection, covering data collection and analysis, pre-processing, model architecture, training and validation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of network architecture in deep learning. It is a type of artificial neural network that processes pixel-based images as input and is used for image recognition. This review paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and professionals working on grape leaf disease detection using deep learning techniques.
